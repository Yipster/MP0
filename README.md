# Goal of the Project
This project serves as an introduction into using Go. Most importantly, it highlights the use of go channels and go routines to achieve things sychronously and in parallel.
There are two main goals for this program. First is to ping ip addresses in parallel and to display and observe the statistics outputted from the ping. Second is to compare the results using GOMAXPROCS and see how it affects performance of the program.

# How to run the program
This program can be run in the terminal. Most importantly, it is set up to run on the Mac OS, but is untested for Windows or Linux systems. It can be run using go run main.go as shown below.
